Clone the GitHub repository and run the index.html file in your browser. Or you can use the Demo link to start the game.

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/HelenaJagodnikKuhar/nanodegree-don_not_-fall_in_love_game
$ cd nanodegree-arcade_game_frogger
$ http-server [path]
```

### Playing the game

The game has a Player - a girl who is scared to fall in love, therefore, she avoids Enemies - hearts.

The game starts when the timer starts to run. Use the arrow keys to move the player - a girl around the playfield while avoiding Enemies - hearts. 
She will win and gain a score when she reaches water blocks. She is limited with the 20s to do that. Game won adds a point to the score table. 
Game over is when she doesn't reach the water - she runs out of time or when she hits the Enemies - hearts. Game over resets the score. Start the game from the beginning.

Happy playing.
